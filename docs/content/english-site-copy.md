## 2. Our Firm in Brief

Aureus Sigma Capital (ASC) is an independent, founder-owned quantitative investment firm dedicated to Vietnam’s listed equities. We design and maintain systematic, factor-based strategies that apply global institutional standards to local data, trading and regulation.

Our role is to build the investment engine behind Vietnamese equity portfolios. We clean and organise market and company data, codify value, quality and momentum insights, and express them as rules that determine what to own, how much to own and when to adjust. Every holding in the portfolio can be traced back to this documented framework.

ASC does not manage client accounts or distribute products directly. Our strategies are implemented exclusively by ASC’s licensed partners, which handle client onboarding, suitability, execution and reporting. This separation keeps incentives aligned, allows clients to work with regulated counterparties, and enables ASC to focus on research, portfolio design and risk analytics, alongside investing the firm’s own capital in the same strategies.

## 3. Our Philosophy & Approach (used on `/what-we-do`)

### 3.1 Why a structured approach matters in Vietnam

Vietnam’s equity market is fast-moving and often emotional. Prices can move sharply on headlines, capital flows or policy expectations. For long-term investors, the challenge is not access to information, but staying anchored to a consistent discipline when sentiment swings.

Our philosophy is that investors are better served by an approach that is:

- **Systematic** – based on written rules rather than ad hoc opinions or market stories.
- **Factor-driven** – tilting towards proven drivers of equity returns such as value, quality and momentum.
- **Local by design** – built on Vietnamese data, liquidity and regulation, not imported blindly from other markets.
- **Risk-aware** – explicitly designed around drawdowns, liquidity and investor behaviour, not only headline returns.

The objective is clear: seek to deliver attractive long-term, risk-adjusted returns from Vietnamese equities with a path that institutional allocators can understand, monitor and challenge.

### 3.2 From philosophy to framework

We implement this philosophy as a research and engineering process:

- **Data and diagnostics** – collect and clean point-in-time data on Vietnamese companies and prices, focusing on liquidity and disclosure quality.
- **Factor research** – identify robust patterns in how value, quality and momentum have been rewarded across multiple market environments, including past stress episodes.
- **Portfolio rules** – codify those insights into a framework that determines what to own, how much to own and how to adjust as fundamentals, prices and risk change.
- **Testing and review** – test changes rigorously before introducing them into live portfolios and review realised performance, including drawdowns, against expectations.

This framework underpins all strategies built on ASC’s research.

## 4. What We Do – Page Content

### 4.1 How we invest

Our core strategy applies the framework above to a universe of liquid, exchange-listed Vietnamese equities.

1. **Define the investable universe**  
   We start from a universe of liquid, exchange-listed Vietnamese companies with sufficient trading volume, free float and disclosure quality to support institutional execution.

2. **Score companies on core factors**  
   Each company is evaluated along several dimensions, including for example:

   - **Quality** – profitability, balance-sheet strength and earnings resilience.
   - **Value** – cash-flow and earnings yields relative to fundamentals and peers.
   - **Momentum** – the strength and persistence of recent price trends.
   - **Stability and risk** – realised volatility, drawdown profile and liquidity, adding a defensive “low-volatility” lens to the core value, quality and momentum tilts.

ASC’s framework is anchored in three well-documented equity premia—value, quality and momentum—complemented by this stability lens so that proven return drivers are paired with risk controls suited to Vietnam’s volatility.

   These inputs are combined into a structured profile for each stock, updated on a regular schedule using point-in-time data.

3. **Construct the portfolio**  
   The portfolio is built by comparing all eligible companies side by side:

   - Stocks with stronger, more resilient profiles receive larger but controlled allocations.
   - Weaker or less stable profiles receive smaller allocations or are excluded.
   - Portfolio construction respects explicit limits on single-name, sector and factor concentrations, as well as turnover and trading costs.

The result is a coherent portfolio of Vietnamese companies sized relative to their contribution to risk and expected return, rather than a collection of individual “best ideas”.

### 4.2 Human judgement and data working together

Our process is quantitative, but it is not blind automation. Human judgement enters in the design, testing and oversight of the framework:

- deciding which data to trust and how to clean it,
- selecting which factors to emphasise and how to combine them,
- choosing portfolio constraints that reflect the realities of Vietnamese trading and regulation, and
- reviewing how the portfolio behaves across different market environments.

Day-to-day implementation, however, follows written rules. This separation allows us to use human judgement where it adds the most value, while keeping live decisions consistent and repeatable.

### 4.3 How we think about risk and capital behaviour

Risk management is embedded in the framework, not added as an afterthought.

- **Structural diversification** – We hold a meaningful number of names across sectors, with hard caps to prevent any single position or theme from dominating outcomes.
- **Exposure controls** – We monitor the portfolio’s sensitivity to the broad market and adjust exposures when risk moves outside pre-defined ranges for a given mandate.
- **Drawdown awareness** – We track how far the portfolio has moved from recent peaks. If losses extend beyond agreed thresholds, the framework can gradually reduce risk, for example by trimming volatile exposures or tilting further toward higher-quality, more resilient companies. Alongside diversification and exposure limits, we deliberately tilt away from persistently high-volatility names where the risk is not compensated, reinforcing the defensive profile in stressed markets.

These mechanisms will not eliminate losses or protect against every market event. They are designed to make severe setbacks rarer and more manageable, especially in a volatile emerging market.

### 4.4 Our edge in Vietnam

Several features of ASC’s approach are particularly relevant in the Vietnamese context:

- **Market specialisation** – We focus exclusively on Vietnam’s equity market, allowing models and assumptions to be calibrated to local data, liquidity and regulation.
- **Institutional methodology** – Our framework draws on global best practices in systematic factor investing but is adapted for the structure and depth of the Vietnamese market.
- **Transparent factors, not black boxes** – We build on explainable drivers such as value, quality and momentum rather than opaque, hard-to-interpret models.
- **Risk controls built for volatility** – Exposure limits, diversification and drawdown awareness are designed around the higher volatility and liquidity characteristics of an emerging market.

### 4.5 What investors can expect – and what they should not

Over a full market cycle, our goal is to:

- aim to deliver higher risk-adjusted returns than a simple “buy-the-index” approach,
- limit the depth and duration of major drawdowns relative to the broad market, and
- maintain a process that investors can understand, monitor and challenge.

We do not promise outperformance in every period or protection from all market declines. Vietnam is a volatile market and equity investing carries real risk. Our commitment is to a disciplined, transparent framework that treats risk management and drawdowns as central design problems, not marketing language.

## 5. Performance & Risk Analytics

### 5.1 How we present performance

Where available, we present both live and backtested results for ASC’s strategies in a format familiar to institutional allocators. Performance is shown:

- net of estimated management fees and transaction costs, unless stated otherwise;
- relative to appropriate benchmarks such as Vietnam’s main equity index; and
- over multiple horizons (since inception, and rolling one-, three- and five-year periods).

Alongside returns we highlight risk and capital behaviour, including:

- annualised volatility and tracking error;
- Sharpe ratio and information ratio;
- maximum drawdown and time to recovery; and
- exposure and concentration statistics by sector, factor and single name.

### 5.2 Live and simulated history

Vietnam remains a developing market, and our strategies have a shorter live history than large global indices. To give investors a fuller picture, we combine:

- historical simulations based on point-in-time Vietnamese data, which show how the framework would have behaved through multiple market cycles and stress periods; and
- realised live performance, which demonstrates how the framework has operated with actual capital, trading costs and implementation constraints.

Backtests are tools, not promises. They help us and our investors understand the strategy’s sensitivity to different environments, but they are not forecasts. All results are accompanied by clear disclosures on methodology, assumptions and limitations.

### 5.3 Access to detailed reporting

For institutional and professional investors, our partners can provide detailed reports and data files on request, including performance, risk and attribution, subject to product-level terms. We work with ASC’s licensed partners to align reporting with each client’s governance and oversight requirements.

## 5. Partnerships – ASC & Licensed Partners

## 6. Client Solutions

### 6.1 Solutions by client objective

ASC’s framework can support a range of mandates run by ASC’s licensed partners. Rather than leading with products, we help structure solutions around specific objectives:

- **Corporate treasuries** – For balance sheets seeking equity exposure with controlled downside risk, our quality-momentum strategies aim to participate in Vietnam’s growth while limiting deep, prolonged drawdowns relative to the market.
- **Pension funds and insurance portfolios** – For long-horizon capital, our diversified, factor-tilted portfolios provide systematic exposure to Vietnamese equities that can be analysed using familiar risk and factor metrics.
- **Family offices and HNW investors** – For sophisticated individuals and family capital, our rules-based approach offers a transparent complement to discretionary Vietnamese equity allocations, with clear documentation of process and risk controls.

### 6.2 Mandate design parameters

Within the constraints of local regulation and each manager’s licences, strategies built on ASC’s framework can be tailored along dimensions such as:

- target volatility and tracking error ranges;
- permissible sector and concentration limits;
- the role of cash and index futures in managing overall market exposure; and
- environmental, social or governance (ESG) screens where requested and feasible under local data availability.

Minimum investment sizes, fee structures and liquidity terms are set at the product or mandate level by licensed managers. ASC works with those partners to ensure that portfolio construction and reporting remain consistent with the agreed risk and return objectives.

### 6.3 Reporting and transparency

Institutional clients typically receive regular reporting, including performance, risk, factor exposures and portfolio holdings, from the licensed manager. ASC supports this by providing underlying analytics, diagnostics and commentary on strategy behaviour, especially during periods of market stress.

### 5.1 Overview

ASC’s strategies are accessed through regulated investment products and mandates run by ASC’s licensed partners. ASC designs and maintains the systematic framework; licensed partners handle client onboarding, suitability, execution and regulatory reporting.

Together, ASC and its licensed partners offer eligible investors a disciplined way to access Vietnamese equities through factor-driven, rules-based strategies implemented within a regulated structure.

### 5.2 Licensed partners – regulated investment managers

ASC’s licensed partners are regulated investment managers responsible for:

- providing regulated investment products and bespoke mandates under its licences;
- onboarding clients and managing ongoing relationships; and
- implementing portfolios and reporting in line with Vietnamese regulation.

Clients contract directly with the relevant licensed partner. That entity is responsible for ensuring that each product or mandate is suitable for the investor and compliant with local requirements.

### 5.3 ASC – the quantitative research partner

Aureus Sigma Capital is an independent, founder-owned quantitative firm focused exclusively on Vietnam’s equity market. We:

- design and maintain the factor-based investment framework for Vietnamese equities;
- provide research updates, portfolio construction rules and risk analytics; and
- invest our own capital alongside investors who access the strategies through licensed partners.

ASC does not manage client accounts or distribute products. Implementation is carried out exclusively by licensed partners.

### 5.4 How the partnership operates

Under each partnership arrangement, responsibilities are clearly defined:

- **ASC** develops and maintains the systematic investment framework, supplies research updates and diagnostics, and monitors how portfolios behave relative to expectations.
- **Licensed partners** decide how and where to deploy ASC’s strategies, manage day-to-day portfolios under their licences (including execution and cash management), and provide regulated reporting and client service.

This separation between research and implementation clarifies who is responsible for strategy design, portfolio management and regulatory compliance, and supports institutional governance standards.

### 5.5 Looking ahead

As Vietnam’s capital markets deepen and investor requirements evolve, ASC and its licensed partners intend to broaden the range of mandates and products that can incorporate ASC’s framework, while maintaining a disciplined focus on research quality, risk control and regulatory robustness.

### 5.6 Call to action

For investors interested in accessing ASC’s strategies, please contact an ASC licensed partner directly, or reach out to ASC for an introduction and further information on how the framework is applied in practice.
