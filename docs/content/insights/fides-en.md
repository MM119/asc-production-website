# Our Partnership with FIDES

## 1. Overview

FIDES provides the regulated investment platform. Aureus Sigma Capital (ASC) provides the quantitative research and investment framework. Together, we offer eligible investors a disciplined way to access Vietnamese equities through systematic, factor-driven strategies implemented within a regulated structure.

This note explains who FIDES and ASC are, how the partnership works in practice, and what it means for investors considering a Vietnam allocation.

## 2. Who is FIDES?

FIDES is a licensed investment manager with Korean roots operating in Vietnam. It offers investment solutions for both individual and institutional clients, with a focus on transparent, regulated structures and ongoing client service.

In particular, FIDES is responsible for:

- providing **regulated investment products and mandates** under its licences,
- handling **client onboarding and ongoing relationship management**, and
- managing **portfolio implementation, monitoring and reporting** in line with Vietnamese regulation.

Clients contract directly with FIDES or another licensed manager. That entity is responsible for ensuring that each product or mandate is suitable for the investor and compliant with local requirements.

## 3. Who is Aureus Sigma Capital?

Aureus Sigma Capital is an independent, founder-owned quantitative investment firm focused exclusively on Vietnam’s equity market. We design and maintain systematic strategies that apply global institutional standards to local Vietnamese data, trading and regulation.

ASC specialises in:

- building **factor-based models** that tilt towards value, quality and momentum in Vietnamese equities,
- designing **portfolio construction and risk management frameworks** tailored to the realities of Vietnam’s market, and
- providing **research, analytics and ongoing enhancements** to the strategies used by licensed managers.

ASC does not manage client accounts or distribute products. Instead, we act as the quantitative research partner to licensed investment managers such as FIDES. Our own capital is invested alongside that of investors who access the strategy through these partners.

## 4. How the partnership works

Under the memorandum of understanding between FIDES and ASC, responsibilities are clearly defined:

- **ASC**  
  - develops and maintains the systematic investment framework for Vietnamese equities,  
  - supplies research updates, portfolio construction rules and risk analytics, and  
  - supports FIDES with diagnostics and analysis related to portfolios that use the framework.

- **FIDES**  
  - decides **how and where** to deploy ASC’s strategies within its product and mandate architecture,  
  - manages **day-to-day portfolios** under its regulatory licences, including execution and cash management, and  
  - provides **reporting and client service** to investors.

In practice, the investment process works as follows:

1. ASC maintains a set of rules and signals that define what the strategy would own, how much it would own and how it would respond to changing market conditions.
2. FIDES translates those rules into concrete portfolios and products, taking into account client objectives, regulatory constraints, tax considerations and operational details.
3. ASC monitors how the portfolios behave relative to expectations, and periodically refines the framework based on evidence from Vietnamese data and live results.

This structure allows investors to benefit from a dedicated quantitative research engine while retaining the safeguards of a licensed asset manager.

## 5. Why work together?

The partnership between FIDES and ASC combines complementary strengths:

- **Institutional-quality research, local focus** – ASC brings a specialised systematic framework built specifically for Vietnamese equities, using factor concepts that are familiar to global allocators but calibrated to local realities.
- **Regulated implementation and client service** – FIDES provides the licensing, infrastructure and client-facing capabilities required to turn that framework into practical investment products for eligible investors.
- **Aligned incentives** – ASC is an independent, founder-owned firm that invests its own capital alongside external investors. FIDES is responsible for product-level decisions, while ASC remains focused on research quality and risk management.
- **Clear governance** – The separation between research and implementation helps clarify who is responsible for strategy design, portfolio management and regulatory compliance.

For investors, this means they can access a systematic Vietnam equity strategy through a regulated manager, with transparency into both the underlying process and the operating structure.

## 6. Looking ahead

Vietnam’s capital markets continue to develop in depth, liquidity and institutional participation. As this evolution continues, we expect:

- growing interest from regional and global allocators in dedicated Vietnam exposure,
- increasing demand for systematic, rules-based approaches that can be evaluated using familiar factor and risk metrics, and
- more sophisticated requirements around reporting, governance and risk oversight.

FIDES and ASC intend to respond to these trends by expanding the range of mandates and products that can incorporate ASC’s framework, while maintaining a disciplined focus on research quality, risk control and regulatory robustness.
