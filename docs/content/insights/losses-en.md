# How We Try to Limit Big Losses When Markets Fall

Most investors can live with normal day-to-day swings in prices. What is harder to accept—and harder to recover from—are large, extended setbacks, when portfolio values move well below recent peaks and stay there.

At Aureus Sigma Capital (ASC), we do not claim to avoid every difficult period. Vietnam is a volatile emerging market and equity investing carries real risk. Instead, we design our process with a clear aim:

> Reduce the depth and duration of major drawdowns relative to the broad market, while still keeping enough risk on the table to benefit from long-term growth in Vietnamese equities.

This note outlines how we think about large losses and the protections we build into our framework.

## 1. Why large setbacks matter

There is a meaningful difference between:

- a short-term pullback of a few percent that recovers in weeks or months, and
- a deep, extended decline that can take years to repair.

Large drawdowns matter for three reasons:

1. **Compounding** – Recovering from a 10 percent decline requires an 11 percent gain; recovering from a 40 percent decline requires a 67 percent gain. The deeper the loss, the more future return is needed just to get back to even.
2. **Behaviour** – Severe losses increase the chance that investors capitulate near the bottom, turning temporary declines into permanent loss of capital.
3. **Opportunity cost** – Capital locked in deep drawdowns is less available for attractive opportunities that often appear during stress periods.

Because these effects are powerful, we treat drawdown management as a core design problem, not a secondary consideration.

## 2. Accepting what we cannot control

There are elements of market behaviour we cannot control:

- whether a macro shock hits Vietnam or global markets,
- how fast liquidity evaporates during stress, or
- how far prices overshoot fundamentals in either direction.

What we can control is how the portfolio is built before stress arrives and how it responds once it does. In particular, we can choose:

- how concentrated or diversified the portfolio is,
- how much exposure it has to the broad market and to specific risk factors, and
- what actions are triggered when losses pass certain thresholds.

Our framework is designed around these controllable elements, while accepting that markets themselves will remain unpredictable.

## 3. Building resilience into the portfolio

The first layer of defence is the way we construct the portfolio in normal conditions:

- **Diversification with limits** – We hold a meaningful number of names across sectors, but we also cap single-name and sector exposures so that no single stock or theme can dominate results.
- **Quality and balance-sheet focus** – All else equal, companies with stronger cash flows and more resilient balance sheets tend to be better positioned to navigate downturns. Our factor framework reflects this.
- **Liquidity awareness** – We favour stocks with sufficient trading volume and free float to support institutional execution. This helps preserve flexibility when conditions deteriorate.
- **Cost and turnover control** – By managing turnover and transaction costs, we avoid unnecessary erosion of capital that can compound the impact of a large market decline.

These choices do not prevent drawdowns, but they improve the starting position when markets turn.

## 4. Pre-defined responses to difficult periods

The second layer of defence is how we respond when losses accumulate.

For each mandate, we define drawdown ranges that we consider acceptable relative to the market and the strategy’s objectives. When the portfolio moves beyond those ranges, the framework can call for a measured reduction in risk, for example by:

- trimming exposures to more volatile or weaker-profile names,
- tilting further towards higher-quality, more resilient companies, or
- reducing overall market exposure within the constraints of the mandate.

The goal is not to sell at every dip, but to avoid remaining fully exposed when evidence suggests that conditions have shifted into an unusually adverse regime.

These responses are prepared in advance and implemented systematically, rather than improvised in the middle of stress.

## 5. Trade-offs we deliberately accept

Any attempt to limit big losses involves trade-offs. We accept several of them explicitly:

- **We may lag in sharp, V-shaped rebounds** if risk has been reduced during a drawdown and is then rebuilt gradually.
- **We may endure normal corrections without reacting** if losses remain within pre-agreed ranges, to avoid over-trading and whipsaw.
- **We may differ meaningfully from the index at times**, because diversification limits, quality tilts and liquidity filters change the portfolio’s composition relative to the broad market.

We view these as acceptable costs of a process that treats large drawdowns as a central risk and sets out in advance how to respond when they occur.

We also treat difficult periods as important sources of information. After significant drawdowns, we review:

- how the portfolio behaved relative to the market and relevant benchmarks,
- which types of companies contributed most to losses or resilience, and
- whether the responses triggered by the framework were sufficient, too slow or too aggressive.

Where the evidence supports it, we refine our signals, portfolio construction rules or drawdown thresholds. Any modifications are tested using historical Vietnamese data, including past stress episodes, before entering live use.

## 6. Putting it together

When we talk about limiting big losses, we are not promising a fixed maximum drawdown or a smooth return path. Instead, we are committing to a design and monitoring process that:

- recognises large setbacks as a central risk to long-term compounding,
- builds portfolios with diversification, quality and liquidity in mind,
- defines in advance how we will respond when losses breach certain ranges, and
- uses data from real stress periods to keep improving the framework over time.

This approach will not always feel comfortable in the moment; no effective equity strategy is free of volatility. But for investors who want exposure to Vietnam’s growth with a disciplined focus on capital preservation in difficult markets, we believe it is a more robust way to navigate inevitable downturns.
