# Staying Disciplined in a Noisy Market

Vietnam’s equity market is active, fast-moving and often emotional. Prices can move sharply on headlines, flows or policy rumours. For long-term investors, the challenge is not a lack of information, but knowing which signals to act on and which to ignore.

At Aureus Sigma Capital (ASC), our bias is simple:

> Keep portfolio decisions anchored to a clear, rules-based discipline, so that day-to-day noise does not define long-term outcomes.

This note explains what that means in practice and why it matters for investors who want exposure to Vietnam without being pulled into every short-term swing.

## 1. The pull of short-term signals

Most investors recognise the pattern:

- A stock rallies strongly and there is pressure not to “miss the move”.
- A sharp intraday drop triggers doubts about every position.
- New stories appear before the old ones are resolved.

Responding to each development on its own can turn investing into a series of reactions instead of a plan. In a market like Vietnam, where liquidity and sentiment can amplify each other, this can lead to:

- **Over-trading** – frequent shifts in holdings and exposure, often at poor prices.
- **Inconsistent risk** – portfolios that are aggressive after strong runs and defensive only after losses.
- **Story-driven concentration** – too much capital in the latest theme and too little in durable, cash-generating businesses.

Over time, behaviour of this kind tends to hurt both performance and decision quality. Our discipline is designed to counteract these pulls.

## 2. From philosophy to framework

Instead of treating every headline as a signal, we anchor our decisions on three elements we can define and measure.

1. **The type of companies we want to own**  
   We focus on Vietnamese businesses that exhibit characteristics associated with stronger long-term outcomes, such as:
   - resilient profitability and balance sheets,
   - attractive valuations relative to fundamentals, and
   - price behaviour that reflects healthy underlying demand for the shares.

2. **The weight each position should have**  
   Each stock competes for capital against every other eligible name. Position sizes reflect its overall profile, not a single story or recent move. We set explicit limits on:
   - single-name and sector concentration,
   - portfolio sensitivity to the broad market, and
   - turnover and trading costs.

3. **A defined review and rebalance rhythm**  
   We update data and reassess portfolios on a set cadence. This allows us to respond to meaningful changes in fundamentals, prices or risk without reacting to every intraday fluctuation.

Day-to-day noise still occurs, but it is filtered through this framework rather than driving decisions directly.

## 3. Structure around day-to-day decisions

In practice, our investment discipline combines research, rules and monitoring:

- **Research-driven signals** – We use Vietnamese company and market data to build systematic signals around factors such as value, quality and momentum. These are implemented through transparent rules rather than ad hoc judgement.
- **Portfolio construction rules** – The portfolio is assembled to balance expected return, diversification and liquidity. Stronger profiles receive larger but controlled allocations; weaker names receive smaller weights or are excluded.
- **Risk and drawdown ranges** – For each mandate, we define ranges of capital fluctuation that we consider acceptable, relative to the market and the strategy’s objectives. If conditions move beyond those ranges, the framework can call for reduced risk, for example by trimming exposures or tilting towards more resilient exposures.
- **Ongoing diagnostics** – We track how the portfolio behaves in different environments and compare realised outcomes with expectations. When we refine the framework, changes are tested across history before they are introduced into live portfolios.

This structure does not remove judgement. It channels judgement into how the framework is designed and maintained, rather than into day-to-day stock picking.

## 4. Why this matters for investors

For investors, a structured discipline offers several practical benefits:

- **Clarity** – You can understand what the strategy is trying to do—participate in Vietnam’s growth by tilting towards higher-quality, better-valued, stronger-momentum companies—without needing to follow every implementation detail.
- **Consistency** – The same philosophy applies in rising markets and falling markets. We do not change the core approach simply because sentiment has shifted.
- **Predictable responses** – Because rules are written down in advance, it is easier to see how the portfolio is likely to react to different environments, including stress periods.
- **Better opportunity to improve** – When decisions follow a repeatable process, we can measure what worked and what did not, and refine the framework using data rather than memory or narratives.

Markets will always be noisy, and uncertainty cannot be engineered away. What can be designed is the way capital is deployed, monitored and adjusted through time. For ASC, staying disciplined in a noisy market means giving investors a strategy whose behaviour is driven by a clear, testable framework, not by whoever happens to be the loudest voice on a given day.
