Volatility clustering and regime changes are inherent features of emerging markets. Our objective is to minimize maximum drawdown (post-fee) while maintaining high participation in positive market phases.

We acknowledge we cannot control the market or predict every downturn. Instead we define in advance what actions occur when losses cross certain thresholds.

Diversification, position limits, and total exposure caps reduce the impact of any single stock or theme.

When losses approach our tolerance, rules may call for trimming exposure or using stock index futures to reduce net market risk. If stress deepens, the response escalates.

These protective steps can cause us to lag sudden rebounds or incur hedging costs, but we accept that trade-off to keep risk aligned with our mandate.
