Market microstructure dynamics often outpace human reaction times. Behavioral biases and noise trading can lead to suboptimal execution and emotional decision-making.

ASC defines its rules in advance: what we can own, when we buy or sell, how large each position may be, and how quickly the portfolio can change.

Because the rules are written down, we can review decisions objectively, refine the process using data, and keep responses consistent during stress.

The approach starts with a liquid universe of leading Vietnamese companies. We combine price behaviour, company fundamentals, and risk characteristics, then size positions within documented limits.

Risk checks are embedded at each step. If losses reach predefined thresholds, the rules tell us to slow down or reduce exposure. It is not about predicting the future; it is about executing the same way regardless of headlines.
