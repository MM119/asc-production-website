FIDES (Vietnam) Fund Management JSC and Aureus Sigma Capital have signed a memorandum of understanding to collaborate on the research and development of rules-based, systematic investment strategies for the Vietnamese equity market.

Under the collaboration, Aureus Sigma Capital provides quantitative research, portfolio design input, and model strategies. FIDES Vietnam independently evaluates, adapts, and implements these strategies within internal pilot portfolios. FIDES Vietnam retains full responsibility for all investment decisions, portfolio construction, risk management, and regulatory compliance.

The joint work focuses on combining market data, company fundamentals, and predefined risk guardrails to support more consistent, evidence-based portfolio construction. The initial scope is limited to internal pilot portfolios used for testing and evaluation.

"As the Vietnamese equity market continues to deepen, we see growing value in systematic, evidence-based investment processes. This collaboration allows us to explore how quantitative research and rules-based frameworks can complement our existing fundamental investment expertise."

"Our work with FIDES Vietnam is about turning robust, data-driven research into practical, transparent investment processes that fit the realities of the local market. By starting with internal pilot portfolios, we can rigorously test and refine systematic strategies before any potential broader application."

Initially, the collaboration concentrates on Vietnamese listed equities, with room over time to explore additional techniques or asset classes, subject to applicable regulations and FIDES Vietnam's independent assessment.
