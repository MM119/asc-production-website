FIDES, a licensed investment manager with Korean roots operating in Vietnam, and Aureus Sigma Capital, a Vietnam-based investment firm focused on rules-based strategies for Vietnamese equities, have signed a strategic memorandum of understanding.

Vietnam’s stock market has grown rapidly, yet many portfolios are still managed using short-term opinions. Both firms see an opportunity to deliver disciplined, rules-based exposure while keeping investor protection and compliance at the center of the process.

Aureus Sigma Capital designs, tests, and maintains the rules that govern how portfolios are built and risk is managed. The research process blends market data, company information, and predefined guardrails.

FIDES is responsible for offering and managing any investment products that may use ASC’s strategies, including onboarding clients, executing portfolios, monitoring positions, and reporting under Vietnamese regulations.

Under the partnership, ASC provides its rulebook, research updates, and risk oversight; FIDES determines how the strategies are deployed within its licensed vehicles. ASC does not offer products directly to the public and does not handle client funds.

Over time the firms plan to expand the range of systematic approaches in Vietnam while holding to one principle: transparent rules and risk management first.

Strategies and investment frameworks developed by Aureus Sigma Capital (ASC) are implemented by ASC’s licensed partners for eligible investors under applicable regulation.
